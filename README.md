# MusicWave_-Project
🎵 MusicWave: Data Analysis with Chinook SQLite 🎵
📝 Project Overview
This project uses the Chinook SQLite database to analyze music-related data, such as albums, artists, and genres. The goal is to explore the database using SQL queries and visualize insights with Python libraries like Pandas and Seaborn.

The Chinook database simulates a digital media store and provides comprehensive data on albums, artists, customers, genres, and invoices.

🔧 Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed before starting:

Python 3.x 🐍
Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab 📒
SQLite3 for database handling 🗄️
Pandas for data manipulation 🐼
Matplotlib or Seaborn for data visualization 📊
Install necessary packages using pip (if running locally):

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn sqlite3
🚀 Project Setup and Execution
Step 1: Environment Setup ⚙️
If you're working on Google Colab, upload the Chinook SQLite database.
If you're using Jupyter Notebook, ensure the database is placed in your project folder.
Example code to upload a file in Colab:

python
Copy code
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()
Step 2: Connecting to the Database 🔗
Establish a connection to the database using the sqlite3 library:
python
Copy code
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite')
cursor = conn.cursor()
Step 3: Running SQL Queries 🔍
Run the following SQL query to retrieve data from the albums table:
python
Copy code
query = '''
SELECT Title, ArtistId 
FROM albums
LIMIT 10;
'''
cursor.execute(query)
albums = cursor.fetchall()
Step 4: Fetching the First 10 Albums 🎶
Store the results of the query in a Pandas DataFrame for better visualization:
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
df_albums = pd.DataFrame(albums, columns=['Album Title', 'Artist ID'])
df_albums
This code will output a list of the first 10 albums:

Album Title	Artist ID
For Those About To Rock We Salute You	1
Balls to the Wall	2
Restless and Wild	2
Let There Be Rock	1
Big Ones	3
Jagged Little Pill	4
Facelift	5
Warner 25 Anos	6
Plays Metallica By Four Cellos	7
Audioslave	8
Step 5: Analyzing the Data 📊
Let’s run more queries to explore genres or customers, visualize them, and generate insights. For example, you can analyze how many tracks each genre has:
python
Copy code
query_genre = '''
SELECT genres.Name, COUNT(tracks.TrackId) AS TrackCount
FROM tracks
JOIN genres ON tracks.GenreId = genres.GenreId
GROUP BY genres.Name
ORDER BY TrackCount DESC;
'''
cursor.execute(query_genre)
genre_data = cursor.fetchall()

# Convert to DataFrame
df_genre = pd.DataFrame(genre_data, columns=['Genre', 'Track Count'])
Step 6: Visualizing Data 📈
Use Seaborn to visualize the distribution of tracks across genres:
python
Copy code
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.barplot(x='Genre', y='Track Count', data=df_genre)
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
plt.title('Track Count by Genre')
plt.show()
Step 7: Saving Results 💾
Export the data into a CSV file for further use:
python
Copy code
df_albums.to_csv('top_10_albums.csv', index=False)
Step 8: Closing the Database Connection 🔒
Always remember to close the database connection when you're done:
python
Copy code
conn.close()
📑 Results
Extracted the first 10 albums from the Chinook database.
Created insightful visualizations, such as Track Count by Genre.
Saved query results for future use.
📋 Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrated how to connect to a SQLite database, extract data using SQL, and process it using Python. The process provided insights into the albums, artists, and genres stored in the Chinook database.

Whether you're a beginner looking to practice your SQL skills or a data scientist wanting to explore a new dataset, this project is a great place to start.

🎯 Future Work
Customer Insights: Analyze customer purchase patterns.
Sales Analysis: Explore total sales by genre and artist.
Revenue Trends: Investigate revenue trends by invoice date.
